# Spotify-and-Youtube-Data-Analysis
The dataset in question is a comprehensive collection of music tracks from all over the world, representing a diverse range of artists and genres. Each track is accompanied by a set of statistical metrics that provide insight into its performance on Spotify, such as the number of times it has been streamed. In addition to this, the dataset also includes data on the official music video views for each song on YouTube.

To aid in the analysis, I employed the use of Power Query to preprocess and transform the data. This allowed me to extract important insights from the data and to streamline the data preparation process. For example, I used Power Query to clean up and format the data, to remove duplicates, and to split up columns as necessary.

Finally, to effectively communicate the insights that I had discovered, I developed a dashboard. The dashboard allowed me to visualize the data in a way that was easily digestible and accessible to a wider audience. For instance, I was able to create visualizations that depicted the relationship between a track's performance on Spotify and the number of views on its official YouTube music video. This helped me to identify which tracks were experiencing the most success on both platforms.

In conclusion, the analysis of this music dataset revealed a number of valuable insights into the behavior of music listeners and the impact of different factors on a track's popularity. Through the use of Power Query and dashboard creation, I was able to make sense of the complex data and communicate my findings in a clear and concise manner.
