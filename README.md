# Spotify-and-Youtube-Data-Analysis
The dataset in question is a comprehensive collection of music tracks from all over the world, representing a diverse range of artists and genres. Each track is accompanied by a set of statistical metrics that provide insight into its performance on Spotify, such as the number of times it has been streamed. In addition to this, the dataset also includes data on the official music video views for each song on YouTube.

To aid in the analysis, I employed the use of Power Query to preprocess and transform the data. This allowed me to extract important insights from the data and to streamline the data preparation process. For example, I used Power Query to clean up and format the data, to remove duplicates, and to split up columns as necessary.


Finally, to effectively communicate the insights that I had discovered, I developed a dashboard. The dashboard allowed me to visualize the data in a way that was easily digestible and accessible to a wider audience. For instance, I was able to create visualizations that depicted the relationship between a track's performance on Spotify and the number of views on its official YouTube music video. This helped me to identify which tracks were experiencing the most success on both platforms.

In conclusion, the analysis of this music dataset revealed a number of valuable insights into the behavior of music listeners and the impact of different factors on a track's popularity. Through the use of Power Query and dashboard creation, I was able to make sense of the complex data and communicate my findings in a clear and concise manner.

# Key Findings
* The analysis reveals that there are noteworthy disparities between the top 10 artists based on their popularity on YouTube and Spotify. Ed Sheeran currently holds the number one position on YouTube with a total view count of 15.5 billion, whereas Post Malone has the highest number of streams on Spotify, with a total streaming count of 15 billion. These divergences can be attributed to the contrasting nature of the two platforms. YouTube is a video-sharing platform, where users can view and share music videos, live performances, and other types of content, whereas Spotify is a music streaming platform that allows users to listen to their favorite songs, create playlists, and discover new music. Moreover, the user base and content recommendation algorithms of the two platforms differ, which also affects an artist's popularity on each platform. YouTube's algorithm recommends music videos based on the user's search history, watch history, and other preferences, while Spotify's algorithm recommends songs based on the user's listening history and preferences. Therefore, an artist's popularity on YouTube may be driven by the number of views on their music videos, while on Spotify, it may be determined by the number of times their songs have been streamed.It is crucial to understand the context of each platform when evaluating an artist's popularity. Although view counts on YouTube and streaming counts on Spotify are important metrics for measuring an artist's success, they may not provide a complete picture of their overall popularity and impact. The popularity of an artist on both platforms should be considered to gain a more comprehensive understanding of their success.
* Based on the analysis, it appears that there is a slight difference in the number of streams on Spotify compared to the number of views on YouTube for the top artists. Specifically, the difference between the highest streaming artist on Spotify and the highest viewed artist on YouTube is around 5%. 
* Based on the analysis, it appears that albums make up a significant proportion of the overall content available on Spotify. Specifically, albums comprise 72% of the content on the platform. This suggests that despite the increasing popularity of individual songs and playlists, albums remain an essential component of the music industry and continue to be a preferred format for many artists and listeners.The dominance of albums on Spotify could also have important implications for the platform's revenue model, as albums tend to generate more revenue per stream than individual songs. Furthermore, the popularity of albums could have a significant impact on the strategies of record labels and streaming services, as they seek to promote and distribute music content in a way that appeals to artists and listeners alike.Overall, the finding that albums comprise a significant proportion of the content on Spotify underscores the continued relevance and importance of this format in the music industry.

In contrast, the song has only 3 billion streams on Spotify, which is 80% less compared to its views on YouTube. This discrepancy can be attributed to the nature of each platform and how users consume content on each of them.the algorithms used by YouTube and Spotify to recommend content to users may also differ, which can affect the popularity of a song on each platform. For example, YouTube's algorithm may recommend music videos based on a user's search history or watch history, while Spotify's algorithm may recommend songs based on a user's listening history and preferences.Overall, it is important to consider the context of each platform when evaluating the popularity of a song. While the number of views on YouTube and streams on Spotify can be useful metrics for measuring a song's success, they may not provide a complete picture of its overall popularity and impact.
